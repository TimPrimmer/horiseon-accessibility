# Website Accessibility Challenge

## Purpose
For this task we had to refactor a given website (Horiseon) to improve its accessibility.

## What ive done
I've gone through and changed most of the div tags to their more appropiate semantic tags. 

These include:
Header
Footer
Section
Nav
Aside

I've gone through and fixed one of the nav links so it links to the correct section (search engine optimization specifically)

The css styling sheet has been slimed down and many of the sections re-used to reduce the amount of unnecessary code and classes being used (.benefits and .content being the main two). This means some of the divs/sections in the index file had their classes removed as they were pointless/redundant.
